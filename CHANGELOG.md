### üöÄ Enhancements

  - **Bundle.js:** Add a new class to handle bundling of multiple sources into a single output The Bundle class is a new class that handles the bundling of multiple sources into a single output. It has methods to add sources, append strings, clone the bundle, generate a source map, get the indent string, indent the bundle, prepend strings, convert the bundle to a string, check if the bundle is empty, and trim the bundle. The Bundle class is useful for bundling multiple sources into a single output, such as when building a web application or library. ([8f79d9b](https://github.com/nyxb/wizard-string/commit/8f79d9b))
  - **BitSet.js:** Add BitSet class to the project The BitSet class is a new addition to the project. It provides a way to manipulate bits in a set. The class has two methods: add and has. The add method sets the bit at the given index to 1, while the has method checks if the bit at the given index is set to 1. ([d3033fe](https://github.com/nyxb/wizard-string/commit/d3033fe))
  - **Chunk.js:** Add Chunk class to handle code splitting and editing The Chunk class is added to handle code splitting and editing. It contains methods to append and prepend content to the left and right of the chunk, clone the chunk, check if an index is contained within the chunk, iterate over the next and previous chunks, edit the content of the chunk, split the chunk at a given index, and trim the start and end of the chunk. ([bfc98ac](https://github.com/nyxb/wizard-string/commit/bfc98ac))
  - **SourceMap.js:** Add SourceMap class to generate source maps This commit adds a new file, SourceMap.js, which contains a class that generates source maps. The class takes in a set of properties and generates a source map object with the version, file, sources, sourcesContent, names, mappings, and x_google_ignoreList properties. The class also has two methods, toString() and toUrl(), which return the source map object as a string and a data URL, respectively. The source map object is generated using the @jridgewell/sourcemap-codec library. ([5dc9426](https://github.com/nyxb/wizard-string/commit/5dc9426))
  - **getLocator.js, getRelativePath.js:** Add utility functions for source map generation The getLocator.js file exports a function that takes in a source string and returns a function that can be used to locate a character index in the source string to a line and column number. This is useful for generating source maps. ([3d5eabb](https://github.com/nyxb/wizard-string/commit/3d5eabb))
  - **guessIndent.js:** Add function to guess the indentation of a code string This commit adds a new function called guessIndent that takes a code string as input and returns a string representing the guessed indentation of the code. The function checks for the presence of tabs and spaces in the code and returns the most common type of indentation. If there is a tie, the function defaults to tabs. If there is no indentation, the function returns null. This function will be useful for auto-formatting code in the future. ([db22a01](https://github.com/nyxb/wizard-string/commit/db22a01))
  - **isObject.js:** Add isObject utility function The isObject utility function is added to the project. It checks if the passed argument is an object by using the Object.prototype.toString method. ([4069e95](https://github.com/nyxb/wizard-string/commit/4069e95))
  - **utils:** Add Mappings and Stats classes The Mappings class provides a way to generate source maps for JavaScript files. It has methods to add edits and unedited chunks to the source map. The Stats class provides a way to measure the time taken by a function or a block of code. It has methods to start and end a timer and calculate the elapsed time. ([9f50acf](https://github.com/nyxb/wizard-string/commit/9f50acf))
  - **index.js:** Add WizardString, Bundle, and SourceMap exports This commit adds the WizardString, Bundle, and SourceMap exports to the index.js file. These exports can now be used by other modules that import this file. ([f9f07ae](https://github.com/nyxb/wizard-string/commit/f9f07ae))
  - **index-legacy.js:** Add WizardString, Bundle, and SourceMap classes to the export list This commit adds the WizardString, Bundle, and SourceMap classes to the export list of the index-legacy.js file. This allows for easier importing of these classes from other modules. ([091dc57](https://github.com/nyxb/wizard-string/commit/091dc57))
  - **WizardString.js:** Add WizardString, main functionality ([c53eb82](https://github.com/nyxb/wizard-string/commit/c53eb82))
  - **IntegrityCheckingWizardString.js:** Add IntegrityCheckingWizardString class to check the integrity of the WizardString class The IntegrityCheckingWizardString class extends the WizardString class and adds a checkIntegrity() method to check the integrity of the linked list. The checkIntegrity() method checks that all chunks are linked correctly and that the byStart and byEnd maps are consistent with the linked list. The class also overrides all methods of the WizardString class to call the checkIntegrity() method after each invocation to ensure that the linked list remains consistent. ([9f1315b](https://github.com/nyxb/wizard-string/commit/9f1315b))
  - **app:** Add support for inline source maps The changes add support for inline source maps to the app. The app now has a new build script that transpiles the source code and generates a source map. The transpiled code and the source map are then written to separate files. Additionally, the build script generates a new file with the transpiled code and the source map inline. The index.html file is updated to reference the new inline source map file. The changes also include renaming the 'magic' string to 'wizard' in the test file. ([e5257af](https://github.com/nyxb/wizard-string/commit/e5257af))
  - **benchmark): add benchmarking script to measure performance of WizardString class üîç chore(.eslintignore:** Ignore benchmark directory in eslint The benchmark script measures the performance of various methods of the WizardString class. The script uses the Benchmark.js library to run the benchmarks. The results of the benchmarks are logged to the console. The benchmark directory is now ignored in eslint to avoid linting errors. ([74a2f70](https://github.com/nyxb/wizard-string/commit/74a2f70))

### üè° Chore

  - **.eslintrc): disable some eslint rules üîß chore(.vscode/settings.json): format file and add eslint fix on save üöÄ feat(package.json): update package name and exports to match new name üîß chore(package.json:** Add consolji to devDependencies and add lint:fix script The changes in .eslintrc and .vscode/settings.json are just configuration changes. The changes in package.json are to update the package name and exports to match the new name. The addition of consolji to devDependencies is to add a console logger to the project. The lint:fix script is added to run eslint with the --fix flag to automatically fix some linting errors. ([de6ac62](https://github.com/nyxb/wizard-string/commit/de6ac62))
  - **.eslintignore): add rollup.config.js to ignore list üöÄ feat(rollup.config.js): add rollup configuration for esm, cjs, and umd formats üîß chore(test:** Add .eslintrc and mocha.opts files for test configuration The ignore list is updated to exclude the rollup.config.js file from being linted. The rollup.config.js file is added to configure the rollup bundler to generate esm, cjs, and umd formats. The test configuration is added to include the .eslintrc and mocha.opts files for test configuration. ([c1d4ae4](https://github.com/nyxb/wizard-string/commit/c1d4ae4))

### ‚úÖ Tests

  - **WizardString.SourceMap.js:** Add tests for WizardString.SourceMap class This commit adds tests for the WizardString.SourceMap class. The tests ensure that the ignore list information is preserved and serialized correctly. The tests use the assert library to check the expected behavior of the class. ([2f4b300](https://github.com/nyxb/wizard-string/commit/2f4b300))
  - **WizardString.Bundle.js:** Add tests for WizardString.Bundle ([31a1270](https://github.com/nyxb/wizard-string/commit/31a1270))
  - **WizardString.js:** Add tests for WizardString ([f3f6e91](https://github.com/nyxb/wizard-string/commit/f3f6e91))
